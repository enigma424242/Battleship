# Battleship

8 enemy ships are designated to random locations on a 6x6 plain.
Rows are designated 1-6 and columns are designated a-f.
You are given 24 missiles.
To fire a missile at a designated location enter the desired coordinates.
Example: a1
WARNING:
If you fire a missile outside of the 6x6 plain or at an undefined location
then you will waste ammunition.
Be careful and good luck!
